  abstract={Video understanding is a pivotal task in the digital era, yet the dynamic and multievent nature of videos makes them labor-intensive and computationally demanding to process. Thus, localizing a specific event given a semantic query has gained importance in both user-oriented applications like video search and academic research into video foundation models. A significant limitation in current research is that semantic queries are typically in natural language that depicts the semantics of the target event. This setting overlooks the potential for multimodal semantic queries composed of images and texts. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, ICQ, for localizing events in videos with multimodal queries, along with a new evaluation dataset ICQ-Highlight. Our new benchmark aims to evaluate how well models can localize an event given a multimodal semantic query that consists of a reference image, which depicts the event, and a refinement text to adjust the images' semantics. To systematically benchmark model performance, we include 4 styles of reference images and 5 types of refinement texts, allowing us to explore model performance across different domains. We propose 3 adaptation methods that tailor existing models to our new setting and evaluate 10 SOTA models, ranging from specialized to large-scale foundation models. We believe this benchmark is an initial step toward investigating multimodal queries in video event localization.},

  abstract={Understanding videos is an important research topic for multimodal learning. Leveraging large-scale datasets of web-crawled video-text pairs as weak supervision has become a pre-training paradigm for learning joint representations and showcased remarkable potential in video understanding tasks. However, videos can be multi-event and multi-grained, while these video-text pairs usually contain only broad-level video captions. This raises a question: with such weak supervision, can video representation in video-language models gain the ability to distinguish even factual discrepancies in textual description and understand fine-grained events? To address this, we introduce SPOT Prober, to benchmark existing video-language models's capacities of distinguishing event-level discrepancies as an indicator of models' event understanding ability. Our approach involves extracting events as tuples (<Subject, Predicate, Object, Attribute, Timestamps>) from videos and generating false event tuples by manipulating tuple components systematically. We reevaluate the existing video-language models with these positive and negative captions and find they fail to distinguish most of the manipulated events. Based on our findings, we propose to plug in these manipulated event captions as hard negative samples and find them effective in enhancing models for event understanding.},

  abstract={Video-Text Retrieval (VTR) is a crucial multi-modal task in an era of massive video-text data on the Internet. A plethora of work characterized by using a two-stream Vision-Language model architecture that learns a joint representation of video-text pairs has become a prominent approach for the VTR task. However, these models operate under the assumption of bijective video-text correspondences and neglect a more practical scenario where video content usually encompasses multiple events, while texts like user queries or webpage metadata tend to be specific and correspond to single events. This establishes a gap between the previous training objective and real-world applications, leading to the potential performance degradation of earlier models during inference. In this study, we introduce the Multi-event Video-Text Retrieval (MeVTR) task, addressing scenarios in which each video contains multiple different events, as a niche scenario of the conventional Video-Text Retrieval Task. We present a simple model, Me-Retriever, which incorporates key event video representation and a new MeVTR loss for the MeVTR task. Comprehensive experiments show that this straightforward framework outperforms other models in the Video-to-Text and Text-to-Video tasks, effectively establishing a robust baseline for the MeVTR task. We believe this work serves as a strong foundation for future studies.},

    abstract = "Various temporal knowledge graph (KG) completion models have been proposed in the recent literature. The models usually contain two parts, a temporal embedding layer and a score function derived from existing static KG modeling approaches. Since the approaches differ along several dimensions, including different score functions and training strategies, the individual contributions of different temporal embedding techniques to model performance are not always clear. In this work, we systematically study six temporal embedding approaches and empirically quantify their performance across a wide range of configurations with about 3000 experiments and 13159 GPU hours. We classify the temporal embeddings into two classes: (1) timestamp embeddings and (2) time-dependent entity embeddings. Despite the common belief that the latter is more expressive, an extensive experimental study shows that timestamp embeddings can achieve on-par or even better performance with significantly fewer parameters. Moreover, we find that when trained appropriately, the relative performance differences between various temporal embeddings often shrink and sometimes even reverse when compared to prior results. For example, TTransE (CITATION), one of the first temporal KG models, can outperform more recent architectures on ICEWS datasets. To foster further research, we provide the first unified open-source framework for temporal KG completion models with full composability, where temporal embeddings, score functions, loss functions, regularizers, and the explicit modeling of reciprocal relations can be combined arbitrarily.",

  abstract={Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are expected to be capable of reasoning with commonsense knowledge as human beings. One example is that humans can reason where and when an image is taken based on their knowledge. This makes us wonder if, based on visual cues, Vision-Language Models that are pre-trained with large-scale image-text resources can achieve and even outperform human's capability in reasoning times and location. To address this question, we propose a two-stage \recognition\space and \reasoning\space probing task, applied to discriminative and generative VLMs to uncover whether VLMs can recognize times and location-relevant features and further reason about it. To facilitate the investigation, we introduce WikiTiLo, a well-curated image dataset compromising images with rich socio-cultural cues. In the extensive experimental studies, we find that although VLMs can effectively retain relevant features in visual encoders, they still fail to make perfect reasoning. We will release our dataset and codes to facilitate future studies.},

  abstract={Prompt engineering is a technique that involves augmenting a large pre-trained model with task-specific hints, known as prompts, to adapt the model to new tasks. Prompts can be created manually as natural language instructions or generated automatically as either natural language instructions or vector representations. Prompt engineering enables the ability to perform predictions based solely on prompts without updating model parameters, and the easier application of large pre-trained models in real-world tasks. In past years, Prompt engineering has been well-studied in natural language processing. Recently, it has also been intensively studied in vision-language modeling. However, there is currently a lack of a systematic overview of prompt engineering on pre-trained vision-language models. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey of cutting-edge research in prompt engineering on three types of vision-language models: multimodal-to-text generation models (e.g. Flamingo), image-text matching models (e.g. CLIP), and text-to-image generation models (e.g. Stable Diffusion). For each type of model, a brief model summary, prompting methods, prompting-based applications, and the corresponding responsibility and integrity issues are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, the commonalities and differences between prompting on vision-language models, language models, and vision models are also discussed. The challenges, future directions, and research opportunities are summarized to foster future research on this topic.},

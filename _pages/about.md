Hi, I am Gengyuan. I am currently pursuing my PhD degree at Ludwig-Maximilian University (aka LMU Munich/University of Munich), supervised by [Prof. Volker Tresp](https://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/~tresp/). 

My research interests include *Video Understanding* and *Visual Reasoning* as an intersection of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.

Prior to this, I attained my bachelor degree (2018) in [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), China and my master degree (2021) in [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/), Germany.

Originally, I am from Hunan, China.
